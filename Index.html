        <p> Hello, I'm Jack Bishop, I have a dog which shes a kelpacollie Named Echo, she's still in her destruction phase breaking everything in her way. I only ever made it to year 11, did not get to finish year 12
          but that has not stopped me from doing different types of work all round.
          During covid I worked in the covid testing centers, as well as I helped at risk housing, get their residents vaccinated, I have also done a fair bit of trade and manual labor work.
          I am very all over the place with my hobbies, I love to play different sports, Mainly AFL, games are a big one, video games and tabletops. Mostly Fps and Warhammer 40k,
          I play the necrons In Warhammer, mostly seige in FPS.</p>

        <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
        <p>What makes IT so interesting to me, mostly started when I fell in love with gaming at an early age, I became an older and realized the passion never went away,
        I built my own computer and I knew I wanted to keep doing it, RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) sparked my interest right away, being one of the bigger named Universities,
        once I found out it had online courses, I jumped at the opportunity to see if they had the course I wanted! What I want to get out of this, more study of course
        but also a job in the field of IT so I can get some real-world experience.</p>
